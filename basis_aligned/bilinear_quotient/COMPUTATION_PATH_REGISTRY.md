# Computation-path registry

This index tracks algebraically folded native paths separately from causal circuit
records. A path can cross module boundaries or retain only selected pieces of a
module. Link every path to the relevant [circuit registry](CIRCUIT_REGISTRY.md),
[module dossiers](circuits/MODULE_DOSSIERS.md), primary receipts, and causal tests.

## Evidence labels

- **Proposed:** endpoint and factors are named, but the folding identity is not yet checked.
- **Exact algebra:** the selected native terms replay exactly under stated inputs/background.
- **Approximate path:** error is measured under a stated distribution and norm.
- **Identified:** frozen terms predict held-out cases and survive plausible controls.
- **Adopted:** the executable path passes its registered causal, composition, and simplicity bars.

Low rank, reconstruction quality, or a weight overlap does not advance a path beyond
`Approximate path`. Quantization is outside this registry's simplicity criterion.

## Required path record

Each detailed path dossier should state:

1. semantic decision point, token positions, endpoint reader, and direction of folding;
2. ordered native factors with tensor shapes, biases, RMS/rotary/nonlinear semantics, and gauges;
3. residual-source decomposition and the exact included and omitted self/cross terms;
4. background or input measure, approximation norm, and exact-replay tolerance;
5. literal program price: independent scalars, tensors, nodes, edges, state, and execution cost;
6. held-out predictive and selective causal falsifiers;
7. linked circuit records and module dossiers.

For a bilinear reader with residual inputs $r=\sum_i r_i$ and $s=\sum_j s_j$,
keep the ordered source terms explicit:

$$
B(r,s)=\sum_{i,j} B(r_i,s_j).
$$

This permits a path to retain, for example, an earlier attention-to-MLP cross term
without treating either complete native module as the semantic unit.

## Current path families

| ID | Direction and endpoint | Candidate native terms | Current evidence | Live handoff |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PATH-SUBJECT-001 | MLP8 input/context forward to L11H3 subject-number write and its downstream readers | Native-axis coordinate, E/A/U/W background coordinate, and their bilinear interaction | Circuit record `grammatical_subject_number.v30`: four-scalar coefficient law and native weight axis held causally; native scalar-only readout is a recorded null; upstream interaction is proposed | Run the frozen upstream-context discovery on its next `CIRCUIT` hour, then use any held interaction to define a narrower folded path |
| PATH-SET2-001 | Regional UK/US output contrast backward through MLP17 to earlier attention9 and MLP16 | Exact residual propagation followed by MLP17 source cross terms | Task-matched `ep` is `.6184` of cue-change norm. Exact 34-source fold identifies attention9 × MLP16 as the leading individual term (`.26094`, family range `.1903–.3220`), followed by MLP14 `.1355`; top-five replay still fails at `.6407`, so the path is distributed | Split attention9 by native heads and test whether head9.8—the established setting1 regional producer—accounts for the leading cross term. Preserve distributed remainder and `ea` head17.2 branch |
| PATH-SET1-001 | MLP9 forward through attention10 into MLP10 and its larger parent | QK/value producer terms and downstream bilinear self/cross terms | Approximate sparse parent screens exist; individual and sign exceptions remain | Use circuit-localized reader/writer evidence to select terms before another folded approximation |
| PATH-UNEMBED-001 | Token or token-family unembedding rows backward through final RMS, MLP17, and earlier contributors | Shared unembedding components, token-specific remainder, MLP17 bilinear terms, selected earlier residual sources | Proposed path family with partial setting3 fits; no adopted full path | Choose one semantic logit contrast and derive its exact backward factors before fitting |
| PATH-EMBED-001 | Embedding forward through selected early decoders to a named intermediate reader | Token/position embedding pieces and selected early attention/MLP self/cross terms | Unopened under the alternating-track directive | Start only from a circuit with a named downstream decision point and selective intervention |
