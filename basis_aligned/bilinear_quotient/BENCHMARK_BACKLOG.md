# Standing benchmark backlog (never let a wake idle while any of these is open)

Honest frontier: 34/36 at +2.93 fresh (75% of model work). Open rungs, by size:
STATUS AUDITED 2026-08-30 against runlogs/_completed.txt and the ledger, because
the [QUEUED] markers below were stale and a wake had begun re-deriving them.
Rungs 1-3 are DONE; rung 4 is the first genuinely open one.

1. FRONT TRANSFER TAX (+1.98 of the +2.93 on fresh): replace empirical tables
   with FOLD tables (weights-derived, transfer-free per §283); refit absorbers
   small. -> fold_front.py
   **DONE** -- 2 completions (21:35 exit=1, 21:38 exit=0; the nonzero exit was
   not a failed experiment, per PRE-FLIGHT F). Written up as ledger **§305**,
   "Fold tables strictly dominate: the transfer tax was avoidable all along":
   both bars HELD with margin, window C +1.390 vs +1.481 and fresh +1.602 vs
   +1.926 -- a third of a nat of transfer tax removed.
2. MIDDLE-ATTENTION BAND (~0.9 in-context): head-level hybrid (motif heads
   swapped, diffuse real) -> head_hybrid.py; then absorbers on the attention
   dictionaries (they have none).
   **DONE** -- ledger **§303** (both bars HELD, +2.3644 on window C, 0.27
   BETTER than the all-dictionary band) and **§304** for head_hybrid_fresh
   (certified on never-seen text). The absorbers-on-attention-dictionaries
   half is NOT done and is the live remainder of this rung.
3. a8 / COUNTING: symbolic count features from raw tokens (deploy-legal)
   -> a8_symbolic.py
   **DONE, and the result was NEGATIVE** -- ledger **§304**: "the
   counting-feature rescue is REFUTED with unusual" force. Closed, not open.
4. DEPLOY GAP (~0.09): two-probe labeling (a10-input probe acc 0.73 for the
   late rungs) -> two_probe_deploy.py
   **OPEN, and the first genuinely open rung**: zero completions, zero ledger
   mentions, and two_probe_deploy.py does not exist. Needs a fitted probe
   before it can run.
5. INDUCTION heads: closed as irreducible-linear, but a *bilinear* stand-in
   (learned low-rank pattern q-k factor + value read) was never tried at the
   head level.
6. Fresh-window certification for every new winner (ledger 22), figure + report
   updates at each frontier move.

Rule (from 2026-08-18 stall): "science arc closed" NEVER implies "benchmark
saturated". A wake with an empty queue must pull from this file first.

7. MODE-CONDITIONED STAND-IN SELECTION (from §§315-322): damage modes are
   component-axis objects. Design: per-position gating -- at positions of
   mode M (causally labeled), keep M's implicated components real (or fit
   M-sliced absorbers); elsewhere use the cheap stand-ins. Register: the
   gated assembly beats the uniform one at matched parameter budget;
   control = random position gating at matched fraction. Requires a
   deployable mode-labeler (probe on the stream -> mode score) -- fit and
   validate that first (deploy gap rules apply).

8. PATTERN-SIDE MECHANISM RUNG (from §332): attention-probed leaves need
   mechanism conditions built from motif patterns composed with value
   reads (e.g. "prev-motif head at L, values carrying X -> fires when
   previous token writes X"). Design before running; this is the ladder
   rung for the census majority.
